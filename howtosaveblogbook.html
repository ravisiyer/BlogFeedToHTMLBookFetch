    <h1>How to save blog book?</h1>
    <p>
      The blog book is dynamically rendered (as HTML) in a pop-up window. Chrome
      browser's Save As ... command used with 'Save as type:' specified as
      'Webpage, HTML Only' does not save the dynamically rendered HTML. Its Save
      As 'Webpage, Complete' saves the dynamically rendered HTML but it also
      saves all the image files in a separate folder. Similarly its Save As
      'Webpage, Single File (*.mhtml)' results in a single .mhtml file being
      created which has all text and images in the (dynamically) rendered page.

      In Chrome browser, I am using&nbsp;<a
        href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/save-rendered-html/pdlopbmgodpapaoeiagfcdcgdhmdpgpk"
        >Save Rendered HTML Chrome extension</a
      >&nbsp; to save the dyanmically rendered HTML as 'HTML Only' with image
      links pointing to blog. But that seems to need a web server like Live
      Server showing the blog book page (and the blog book input form page).

      Print as PDF can be used to save the (dynamically) rendered page as PDF.
